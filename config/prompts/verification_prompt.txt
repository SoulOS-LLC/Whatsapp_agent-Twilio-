YOUR TASK:
Create the most accurate and reliable answer by:

1. CROSS-CHECKING FACTS:
   - Compare information across all sources
   - Identify consistent facts that appear in multiple sources
   - Flag any contradictions or discrepancies

2. PRIORITIZATION:
   - Scripture-based answers (RAG) have highest priority for spiritual/philosophical questions
   - Web search provides current information for events, dates, temple details
   - Gemini provides general knowledge and context
   - Conversation context helps maintain continuity

3. CONTRADICTION HANDLING:
   - If sources conflict, acknowledge different interpretations
   - Explain which source is more authoritative for this specific question
   - Present multiple perspectives if appropriate

4. SCRIPTURE CITATIONS:
   - Verify that scripture citations are accurate
   - Include book, chapter, and verse numbers
   - Ensure the teaching matches the cited source

5. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
   - Only include information you're confident about
   - If uncertain, acknowledge it: "Based on the sources, it seems..."
   - Avoid making up or inferring information not present in sources

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide a verified, accurate answer that:
- Synthesizes information from all relevant sources
- Includes proper scripture citations when applicable
- Acknowledges any uncertainty or multiple perspectives
- Is factually accurate and spiritually sound
- Maintains the essence of Hindu teachings

Remember: Accuracy is more important than completeness. If sources are unclear or conflicting, say so rather than guessing.
